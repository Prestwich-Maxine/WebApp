        <h1>JSON Data Serialization</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript Object Notation</h2>
        
        <div>Here's the PowerPoint I created and presented to my group this week.
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ulOzVP8RRyP8Xn3eQ1lJLwiu9Q93eKv0yG5qicwFJ5g/edit#slide=id.p">
                JSON Slides
            </a>        
        </div>
        
        
            <h3>Creating and calling JSON objects</h3>
            <p>This requires us to use curly braces and list name/value pairs.
            The name field can be anything you would like to call your object, and you
            determine the value of the name. The name field can be used multiple times.
            Names and values are written within curly braces with the name listed first,
            followed by a colon, and then the value. The value must be enclosed in
            double quotes, " ". When written as parsed objects with JSON.parse(),
            the name field must also be enclosed in " ".</p>
            <br>
            var obj1 = {user:"John", age:22, country:"United States"};
            <br>
            var obj2 = {user:"Abby", age: 35, country:"United Kingdom"};
            <br>
            var obj3 = {user:"Will", age:55, country:"India"};
            <br>
            var obj4 = {u1:obj1, u2:obj2, u3:obj3};
            <br>
            <p>If we want to call the user in var obj1, we can call it directly
               in the following way;
               <br> 
               document.getElementById("firstPerson").innerHTML = obj1.user;
             </p>
             <button type="button" onclick="myOjbects()">obj1.user</button>
             <br>
             <div id="firstPerson"></div>
             
             <p>As in JavaScript, we can reference and call different variables.
             For example, I can create a string with the variables to say, "John 
             is not from India but the United States.
             
             document.getElementById("objects").innerHTML = obj1.user+ " is not from  "
             + obj3.country + " but the " + obj1.country + ".";</p>
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="objects()">objects</button>
             
             <p>With JSON objects, we do not have to return to the original variable
             to make changes. We can make changes down the line. Returning to the 
             previous example, if I want to say Italy instead of India, I would change it
             like so:<br>
             obj3.country = "Italy";
             <br>
             document.getElementById("objects").innerHTML = obj1.user+ " is not from  "
             + obj3.country + " but the " + obj1.country + ".";
             <br>
             This could should say that "John is not from Italy but the United States."
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="change()">change</button>
             </p>
             <p>You can also write JSON objects in a couple of different way. The following
             two lines of code will produce the same result. They both refer us to
             obj4 first, then refers us to user "u2" which refers to obj2's user, Abby.
             <br>
             document.getElementById("first").innerHTML = obj4.u2.user;
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="first()">first</button>
             <br>
             document.getElementById("second").innerHTML = (obj4["u2"]["user"]);
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="second()">second</button>
             </p>
             <p>JSON objects can also be written as an array.
             var flowers = ["plumeria","hibiscus","ginger"];
             <br>
             var trees = ["coconut","banana","breadfruit"];
             <br>
             var obj5 = {arr1:flowers, arr2:trees};
             <br>
             document.getElementById("array").innerHTML = (obj5.arr1[1]);
             <br>
             The above code refers to the first array in var obj5 called flowers 
             and wants to pull the object in index 1. Since arrays start an index
             with 0, the object in index 1 is hibiscus.
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="array()">array</button>
             <br>
             You can also refer to multiple objects in an array and combine it 
             with text.
             <br>
             document.getElementById("arrays").innerHTML = (obj5.arr1[1] + 
             " and " + obj5.arr2[1] + " are found in the tropics.");
             <br>
             Obj5 refers to var obj5; arr1 refers to the array called flowers; and
             [1] refers to the object in index 1 which would be hibiscus. Again,
             obj5 refers to var obj5; arr2 refers to the second array called trees;
             and [1] refers to the object in index 1, which would be banana.
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="arrays()">arrays</button>
             </p>
             <h3>JSON Serialization</h3>
             <p>JSON is used in data exchange between JavaScript and servers.
             Regardless of the server technology used, JavaScript is able to 
             communicate with that particular technology through JSON. JSON  
             enables JavaScript to convert objects into string to send to the
             server, which is knkown as serialization.</p>
            
             <p>Here we have an object that needs to be converted to a string:
                 <br>
                 var info = {"name":"John Johnson","street":"Oslo West 16","phone":"555
                 1234567"};
                 <br>
                 We are able to do so by using the stringify function. 
                 <br>
                 var data = JSON.stringify(info);
                 <br>
                 This code
                 <br>
                 document.getElementById("serialize").innerHTML = data;
                 <br>
                 produces this string:
                 <br>
                 <button type="button" onclick="serialize()">Serialize</button>
             </p>
             <h3>JSON Deserialization</h3>
             <p>There is also JSON deserialization which converts strings from the
             server to objects. Here, we have a string: 
             <br>
             var text = '{"name":"John Johnson","street":"Oslo West 16","phone":"555 1234567"}';
             
             <br>
             To convert it, we can use the JSON parser, JSON.parse()
             <br>
             var obj = JSON.parse(text);
             <br>
             This will take the string, parse, it and convert it like so:
             <br>
             <button type="button" onclick="deserialize()">Deserialize</button>
             </p>
            
         </div>
     </body>
